# Tests 

Unless noted otherwise, tests measure usage of time, space, or both.


## Test Data Sets
There should be a suite of test files, some pre-existing and some generated at test time,
containing data with the following characteristics:
* zero bytes
* a single NUL byte
* Files of sizes 1KiB 15Kib, 16Kib, 1023 Kib, 1 MiB, 100 MiB, containing: 
** the encoding's line feed character, if any
** the encoding's line carriage return character, if any
** a series of CR/LF pairs, if the encoding has both
** a series of alternating spaces and newlines
** a series of spaces with no newlines
** a single repeated non-whitespace character in the 7-bit ASCII range, selected randomly at test time
** a single repeated non-whitespace character in the chosen encoding range, selected randomly at test time
** a randomly generated set of characters with 
*** no line breaks
*** randomly set line breaks
*** line breaks on every 79th character
*** line breaks on every 80th character
** A randomly selected set of words from a single-language dictionary, separated by spaces interspersed withrandomly set punctuation at a variable interval, with the same line break conditions as the random-character data sets 
** the first 79 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the first 80 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the first 255 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the first 256 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the complete 'Lorem Ipsum', with 
*** each sentence separated with a space.
*** each sentence separated with a line break.
*** each sentence separated with a space, but with random sets of 2 to 6 sentences separated by line breaks.
** For encodings that permit, files containing
*** the first 1000 words
*** the last 1000 words
*** the complete text
*** a random selection of between 2000 and 15000 words,
from each of
*** *Hamlet* in English
*** *The Wealth of Nations* in English
*** *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* in English
*** *The King James Bible, Revised* in English
*** *The Little Prince*, in French, German, English, Dutch, and Spanish
*** *Le Morte d'Arthur* in Old French and Modern English translation
*** *The Canterbury Tales*, in Middle English and Modern English translation
*** *El Cid*, in Spanish
*** *La Divina Commedia*, in Italian
*** *The Republic* in Classic (Attic) Greek
*** The Christian New Testament in Aramaic, Koine Greek, and Coptic
*** *Commentary on the Gallic Wars* in Classical Latin
*** The Vulgate Bible in Late Latin
*** *War and Peace*, in Russian
*** *The Romance of the Three Kingdoms*, in Chinese (Traditional, Simplified and Pinyin orthographies)
*** *The Great Mirror*, in Japanese 
*** The *Torah* in Hebrew
*** The *Quran*, in standard Arabic
*** The *Bhagavad Gita*, in Sanskrit
*** The *Popul Vuh*, in Qiche and Spanish
*** the first web page on a Google search using the 'I Feel Lucky' tool
*** a 50,000 word by-word travesty tree of three to six of the previous texts selected randomly.

## Initialization

With the applicable files described under [Test Data Sets](#test-data-sets), open the editing system
* from beginning of text
* from end of text
* from calcuated mid-point of text
* from random point in text
* from beginning of randomly selected line in text (if possible)
* from end of randomly selected line in text (if possible)

## Insertion
The insertions tested shall be of:
* a single line break
* a single space followed by a line break
* a single non-whitespace character
* a word, selected at random from a compound dictionary of several languages
* a word, selected as above, followed by a line break
* a randomly selected paragraph from one of the test datasets, preceeded and followed by line breaks

Specified tests include,
* at current insertion point following each of the test initialization examples
* at a randomly selected point in the text, following each of the test initializations
* at a random offset from the insertion point following each of the test initializations
* at end of current line
* at end of previous line
* at start of line following current line
* at end of current paragraph
* at start of current paragraph
* at start of following paragraph
* at start of paragraph 3-6 before current
* at end of paragraph 3-6 before current
* at end of paragraph 3-6 following current
* at start of paragraph 3-6 following current

Measurements shall be taken of these starting inserts, as well as following no less than 100,000 
each of insertions in the same set of conditions (that is, with the previous insertion's completion state being the new start state). A separate test of 100,000 insertions using the above criteria selected at random should follow these tests.
