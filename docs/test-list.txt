## Initialization

* without any open file 
* with an empty file
* with a small (5KiB) file containing datasets as described under [Test Data Sets](#test-data-sets)
* with a 1 MiB file
*

## Test Data Sets
There should be a suite of test files, some pre-existing and some generated at test time,
containing data with the following characteristics:
* zero bytes
* a single NUL byte
* Files of sizes 1KiB 15Kib, 16Kib, 1023 Kib, 1 MiB, 100 MiB, containing: 
** the encoding's line feed character, if any
** the encoding's line carriage return character, if any
** a series of CR/LF pairs, if the encoding has both
** a series of alternating spaces and newlines

** the first 79 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the first 80 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the first 255 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** the first 256 bytes of the commonly used 'Lorem Ipsum' dataset
** For encodings that permit, files containing
*** the first 1000 words
